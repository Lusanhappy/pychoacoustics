KNOWN BUGS

- When the control window is hidden, a dialog box sometimes causes a crash
- Closing the edit preferences window when sending the test e-mail may cause a crash.
This is related to misuse of qthread. As a workaround, when sending a test e-mail, please
wait a few seconds before closing the preferences dialog.
