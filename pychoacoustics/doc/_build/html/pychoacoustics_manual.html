<h2>What is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt>?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-pychoacoustics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> is a software for programming and running
experiments in auditory psychophysics (psychoacoustics). The software
contains a set of predefined experiments that can be immediately run
after installation. Importantly <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> is designed to be
extensible so that users can add new custom experiments with relative
ease. Custom experiments are written in Python, a programming language
renowned for its clarity and ease of use. The application is divided in
two graphical windows a) the “response box”, shown in
Figure <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-response-box"><em>The pychoacoustics response box</em></a>, with which listeners interact
during the experiment b) the control window, shown in
Figure, that contains a series of widgets
(choosers, text field and buttons) that are used by the experimenter to
set all of the relevant experimental parameters, which can also be
stored and later reloaded into the application.</p>
<div class="figure" id="fig-response-box">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="figures/response_box.png"><img alt="The pychoacoustics response box" src="figures/response_box.png" /></a>
<p class="caption">The pychoacoustics response box</p>
</div>
<p>I started writing <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> for fun and for the sake of
learning around 2008 while doing my PhD with Professor Chris Plack at
Lancaster University. At that time we were using in the lab a MATLAB
program called the “Earlab” written by Professor Plack.
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> has been greatly influenced and inspired by the
“Earlab”, and it reproposes many of the same features that the “Earlab”
provides. For this reason, as well as for the patience he had to teach
me audio programming I am greatly indebted to Professor Plack.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="installation">
<h2>Installation<a class="headerlink" href="#installation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> has been successfully installed and used on Linux and
Windows platforms, since it is entirely written in python it should be
fully cross-platform and should work on the Mac as well, but this has
never been tested. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> depends on the installation of a
handful of other programs:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Python (version 3) <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/">http://www.python.org/</a></li>
<li>pyqt4
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download">http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download</a></li>
<li>numpy
<a class="reference external" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/</a></li>
<li>scipy
<a class="reference external" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/scipy/files/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/scipy/files/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>these programs need to be installed manually. Once these programs are
installed you can proceed with the installtion of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt>.</p>
<div class="section" id="installation-on-linux">
<h3>Installation on Linux<a class="headerlink" href="#installation-on-linux" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Binary deb packages for recent debian-based distributions are provided
(starting from Wheezy), and can be installed using gdebi which
automatically handles dependencies. For other linux systems, once all of
the dependencies have been installed, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> can be
installed as a standard python package using</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>sudo python3 setup.py install</pre>
</div>
<p>you can then invoke <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> from a terminal by typing the
command</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">pychoacoustics</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">pyw</span>

<h3>Installation on Windows<a class="headerlink" href="#installation-on-windows" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<div class="section" id="using-the-binary-installer">
<h4>Using the binary installer<a class="headerlink" href="#using-the-binary-installer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>After installing the dependencies (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pyqt4</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">numpy</span></tt>, and
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">scipy</span></tt>), simply double click on the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> windows
installer to start the installation procedure. Currently the installer
does not provide a launcher. There is, however, a file called
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics-qt4.bat</span></tt> inside the source distribution of
pychoacoustics that after some modifications can be used as a launcher.
The content of the file is the following:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>C:\Python32\python &quot;C:\Python32\site-packages\pychoacoustics.pyw&quot;
%1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8</pre>
</div>
<p>The first statement <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">C:\Python32\python</span></tt> is the path to the Python
executable. The second statement is the path to the main file of the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> app. You simply need to replace those two statements
to reflect the Python installation on your system.</p>
<p>You can place the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.bat</span></tt> launcher wherever you want, for example on
your <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Desktop</span></tt> folder. Simply double click on it, and
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> should start.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="installing-from-source">
<h4>Installing from source<a class="headerlink" href="#installing-from-source" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>After installing the dependencies, it is recommended to add the
directory where the Python executable resides to the system <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PATH</span></tt>. In
this way you can call <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python</span></tt> from a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">DOS</span></tt> shell by simply typing
its name, rather than typing the full path to the Python executable.</p>
<p>By default <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python</span></tt> is installed in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">C:</span></tt>. The name of the Python
directory depends on its version number, for example, if you installed
Python version 3.2, the python directory will be <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">C:\Python32</span></tt>. To add
this directory to the system path go to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">My</span> <span class="pre">Computer</span></tt> and click
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Properties</span></tt>, then click <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Advanced</span> <span class="pre">System</span> <span class="pre">Settings</span></tt>. In the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">System</span> <span class="pre">Properties</span></tt> window click <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Environment</span> <span class="pre">Variables</span></tt>. There you
will find an entry called <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Path</span></tt>. Select it and click <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Edit</span></tt>. Be
careful not to remove any of the entries that are already written there
because it could corrupt your system. Simply append the name of the full
path of the folder where <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python</span></tt> is installed, at the end of the
other entries.</p>
<p>To install <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> from source, unpack the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt>
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.zip</span></tt> file containing the source code. Open a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">DOS</span></tt> shell and
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cd</span></tt> to the directory where you unzipped pychoacoustics. The program
can then be installed as a standard python package using the following
command:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>python setup.py install</pre>
</div>
<p>If you have installed the dependencies, you can also use pychoacoustics
without installing it. Open a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">DOS</span></tt> shell, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cd</span></tt> to the directory
where you unzipped pychoacoustics and launch it with the following
command:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>python pychoacoustics.pyw</pre>
</div>
<p>As mentioned in the previous section, there is also a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.bat</span></tt> launcher
that can be used to launch <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> without needing to open a
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">DOS</span></tt> shell each time. You can read the previous section for further
info.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="graphical-user-interface">
<h2>Graphical User Interface<a class="headerlink" href="#graphical-user-interface" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The user interface is divided in two windows: the “Control Window” and
the “Response Box”. The “Control Window” is used to set the experimental
parameters, while the “Response Box” is the interface that the listeners
use to give their responses.</p>
<div class="section" id="quickstart">
<h3>Quickstart<a class="headerlink" href="#quickstart" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> is launched, the “Control Window” displays the
default parameters for the “Audiogram” experiment. You can select
another experiment using the “Experiment” drop-down menu, and edit any
of the parameter fields you want to modify. Once you’re satisfied with
the parameters, you can store them by pressing the “Store” button. This
stores one experimental block with the chosen parameters. At this point
you can either start running the experiment by pressing the “Start”
button on the “Response Box”, or you can add more experimental blocks by
clicking on the “New Block” button.</p>
<p>To save the parameters to a file click on the “Save Prm” button.
Parameter files that have been saved in this way can be later loaded
into the program by using the “Load Prm” button.</p>
<p>To save the results of your experiment to a file, click on the “Save
Results” button. If you have forgotten to specify a results file in this
way, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> will save the results in a file called
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">test.txt</span></tt> in the working directory.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-control-window">
<h3>The Control Window<a class="headerlink" href="#the-control-window" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The control window contains a set of widgets to manage the setup of the
experiments, running the experiments, processing results files and
managing application preferences. Some of the widgets are general, and
some of them are specific either to a given paradigm (e.g.&nbsp;adaptive vs
constant stimuli paradigm) or to a given experiment.</p>
<p>In the next section the function of these widgets will be explained,
starting with the widgets that are general to all experiments and
paradigms.</p>
<div class="section" id="general-widgets-left-panel">
<h4>General Widgets (left panel)<a class="headerlink" href="#general-widgets-left-panel" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>[sec:gui:sub:<cite>l</cite>eft<sub>p</sub>anel]</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Listener</strong> This is simply a label that you can use to identify the
person who is running the experiment. This label will be written in
the header of the results file.</li>
<li><strong>Experiment Label</strong>. This is a label to identify the experiment you
are running. This label will be written in the header of the results
file.</li>
<li><strong>Session</strong> This is a label to identify the experimental session, it
can be a number or a string. This label will be written in the header
of the results file.</li>
<li><strong>Condition Label</strong> This is a label to identify the experimental
condition of the current block of trials. It is optional, but it may
be useful when sorting the experimental results.</li>
<li><strong>End Command</strong> Here you can write an operating system command
(e.g.&nbsp;a bash command on Unix systems or a DOS command on Windows
systems) to be performed at the end of the experimental session. This
could be used to run a custom script to analyse the result files,
make a backup of the results files or other purposes. There are some
variables that can be accessed with a special string, such as the
name of the results file. These are listed in
Section&nbsp;[sec:end<sub>c</sub>md] Table&nbsp;[tab:end<sub>c</sub>md].
Please, refer to that section for further info on how to use them.</li>
<li><strong>Shuffling Scheme</strong> By default when you click the “Shuffle” button,
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> randomly shuffles all blocks, here you can specify
different shuffling schemes (e.g.&nbsp;shuffle the first four blocks among
themselves and the last four blocks among themselves). Please refer
to Section&nbsp;[sec:shuffling] for more details.</li>
<li><strong>Results File</strong> Select a file for saving the results. Selecting an
existing file will never overwrite its content, it will simply append
the new results to its content. If no file is selected, the results
will be saved in a file called <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">test.txt</span></tt> in the current working
directory. You can select a file to save the results even after you
have started a block of trials, the results get written to the file
only at the end of the block.</li>
<li><strong>Experimenter</strong> Here you can select one of the experimenters listed
in the experimenter database. Please refer to
Section&nbsp;[sec:experimenters<sub>d</sub>ialog] for further info on the
experimenter database and how it can be used.</li>
<li><strong>Experiment</strong> Selects the experiment for the current block.</li>
<li><strong>Paradigm</strong> Selects the paradigm (e.g. adaptive, constant, etc…) for
the current block. The list of paradigms available depends on the
experiment that is selected.</li>
<li><strong>Phones</strong> Choose from one of the phone models stored in the phones
database. Please, refer to Section&nbsp;[sec:phones<sub>d</sub>ialog] for
further info on how to enter phones and calibration values in the
database.</li>
<li><strong>Sample Rate (Hz)</strong> Set the sampling rate of the sounds to be
played. Any value can be entered in the text fields. However, you
should enter a value that is supported by your soundcard. A value
that is not supported by your souncard may lead to issues, although
it’s more likely that your soundcard will perform an automatic sample
rate conversion.</li>
<li><strong>Bits</strong> Set the bit depth that <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> uses to store
sounds to a wav file or play them. Currently values of 16 and 32 bits
are supported. A value of 32 bits can be used for 24-bit soundcards.
Notice that to achieve 24-bit output requires both a 24-bit souncard
and a play command that can output 24-bit sounds. Therefore selecting
a value of 32 bits here does not guarantee 24-bit playback even if
you have a 24-bit souncard. Please, refere to
Section&nbsp;[sec:sound<sub>o</sub>utput] for further information on this
issue.</li>
<li><strong>Repetitions</strong> Set the number of times the sequence of blocks stored
in memory should be repeated. If the “Shuffle Mode” (see below) is
set to “auto”, each time a new repetition starts the block positions
will be shuffled. If the “Shuffle Mode” is set to “Ask”, each time a
new repetition starts the user will be asked if s/he wants to shuffle
the block positions. The “Reset” button resets the number of
repetitions to zero.</li>
<li><strong>Pre-Trial Silence (ms)</strong> Set a silent time interval before the
start of each trial.</li>
<li><strong>Warning Interval</strong> Choose whether to present a warning light at the
beginning of each trial.</li>
<li><strong>Warning Interval Duration (ms)</strong> Sets the duration of the warning
interval light. This widget is shown only if the warning interval
chooser is set to “Yes”.</li>
<li><strong>Warning Interval ISI (ms)</strong> Sets the duration of the silent
interval between the end of warning interval and the start of the
first observation interval. This widget is shown only if the warning
interval chooser is set to “Yes”.</li>
<li><strong>Pre-Trial Interval</strong> Choose whether to present a pre-trial
interval. This widget is shown only for experiments that have a
pre-trial interval option.</li>
<li><strong>Pre-Trial Interval ISI (ms)</strong> Sets the duration of the silent
interval between the end of pre-trial interval and the start of the
first observation interval. This widget is shown only if the current
experiment has a pre-trial interval option and the pre-trial interval
chooser is set to “Yes”.</li>
<li><strong>Response Light</strong> Set the type of response light at the end of each
trial. &#8220;Feedback&#8221; will flash a green (correct response) or red
(incorrect response) light. &#8220;Neutral&#8221; will flash a white light.
&#8220;None&#8221; will not flash any light (there will nonetheless be a silent
interval equal to the response light duration, see below).</li>
<li><strong>Response Light Duration (ms)</strong> Set the duration of the response
light.</li>
<li><strong>Shuffle Mode</strong> If the “Shuffle Mode” is “auto”, the block
presentation positions will be automatically shuffled at the
beginning of a series of blocks. If the “Shuffle Mode” is “Ask”, at
the beginning of a series of blocks the user will be asked if the
block presentation positions should be shuffled or not. If the
“Shuffle Mode” is “No”, the block presentation positions will not be
automatically shuffled at the beginning of a series of blocks. See
Section&nbsp;[sec:shuffling] for further information on shuffling the
block presentation positions.</li>
<li><strong>Response Mode</strong> When “Real Listener” is selected,
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> waits for responses from a human listener. When
“Automatic” is selected the program will give responses by itself
with a certain percentage correct, that can be specified in the
“Percent Correct (%)” text field. This mode is mostly useful for
debugging purposes, however it can also be used for experiments in
which the participants are passively listening to the stimuli (e.g.
some neuroimaging experiments that record cerebral responses rather
than behavioural responses). In “Simulated Listener” mode
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> will give responses on the bases of an auditory
model. This model needs to be specified in the experiment file, the
“Simulated Listener” mode provides just a hook to redirect the
control flow to your model. Please, refer to
Section&nbsp;[sec:response<sub>m</sub>ode] for more information.</li>

<p>Most of the fields should be pretty much self-explanatory. Here you can
add the details of the experimenters that work in your lab in the
experimenter database. The main functions of this database at the moment
are a) writing the experimenter name in the results file; b) using the
experimenter e-mail for sending notifications and/or results files (see
Section&nbsp;[sec:pref<sub>d</sub>ialog<sub>n</sub>otify]).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-response-box">
<h3>The Response Box<a class="headerlink" href="#the-response-box" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The “response box” consists of a large button (the “status button”) that
is used to start a block of trials, a feedback light to display trial by
trial feedback, interval lights to mark observation intervals, and
response buttons. The responses can be given either by means of mouse
clicks, or using the numeric keypad (key “1” for the first button, key
“2” for the second button etc…). Responses given before all observation
intervals have been presented are not accepted.</p>
<p>The status button can be activated by pressing the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Ctrl+R</span></tt> shortcut.
At the start of each block the label of the “Status Button” is set to
“Start”. Once the listener starts a block of trials the label of the
status button changes to “Running”. When a whole series of blocks is
finished the label of the status button changes to “Finish”. If no
blocks are stored in memory the label of the status button is set to
“Wait”.</p>
<p>On the top left corner of the response box there is a semi-hidden menu
signalled by a little hyphen (“-”). If you click on it you have access
to two functions. The “Show/Hide Control Window” function can be used to
hide the control window while the experiment is running. This is useful
because it prevents the listener from accidentally changing your
experimental parameters or accidentally closing <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> (the
response box itself has no “close” button, so it is not possible to
close that). The “Show/Hide progress Bar” function can be used to
display a progress bar at the bottom of the response box. The progress
bar estimates what percentage of the experiment has been completed. This
estimate depends on the procedure used (for constant procedures it is
based on the number of trials done, while for adaptive procedures it is
based on the number of turnpoints reached) and on the specific
parameters of a given experiment (trial duration, number of trials, or
number or turnpoints, all of which can differ between blocks), so in
some cases the estimate can be off the mark. The “Show/Hide block
progress Bar” can be used to show the position of the current block and
the total number of blocks.</p>

<p>This paradigm implements the “up/down” adaptive procedures described by
. It can be used with <span class="math">\(n\)</span>-intervals, <span class="math">\(n\)</span>-alternatives forced
choice tasks, in which <span class="math">\(n-1\)</span> “standard” stimuli and a single
“comparison” stimulus are presented each in a different temporal
interval. The order of the temporal intervals is randomized from trial
to trial. The “comparison” stimulus usually differs from the “standard”
stimuli for a single characteristic (e.g.&nbsp;pitch or loudness), and the
listener has to tell in which temporal interval it was presented. A
classical example is the 2-intervals 2-alternatives forced choice task.
Tasks that present a reference stimulus in the first interval, and
therefore have <span class="math">\(n\)</span> intervals and <span class="math">\(n-1\)</span> alternatives are also
supported &lt;see&gt;[for an example of such tasks]Grimault2002.</p>

<p>This paradigm implements the weighted up/down adaptive procedure

<p>This paradigm combines the interleaved adaptive procedure described by

<p>This paradigm implements a constant difference method for forced choice
tasks with <span class="math">\(m\)</span>-intervals and <span class="math">\(n\)</span>-alternatives. For example,
it can be used for running a 2-intervals, 2-alternatives forced choice
frequency-discrimination task with a constant difference between the
stimuli in the standard and comparison intervals.</p>
<p>This paradigm implements a constant difference method for tasks with a
single observation interval and two response alternatives, such as the

<h3>Sound Output<a class="headerlink" href="#sound-output" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>[sec:sound:sub:<cite>o</cite>utput]</p>
<p>On Linux systems <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> can either output sound (numpy
arrays) directly to the soundcard, or write a wav file for each sound
and call an external command to play it. Currently, support for sending
sounds directly to the soundcard is possible only through the
<a class="reference external" href="http://pyalsaaudio.sourceforge.net/">alsaaudio</a> python module. This
module is optional, and you need to install it yourself to be able to
use it.</p>
<p>Once it is installed, it will be detected automatically and you will be
able to select it as the “Play Command” in the sound preferences dialog.
When you select &#8220;alsaaudio&#8221; as the play command, if you have multiple
soundcards, you can select the device to which the sound will be sent.
There will be also an option to set the size of the buffer that
alsaaudio uses to play sounds. If the buffer is not filled completely by
a sound (buffer size greater than number of samples in the sound), it
will be zero padded. This may lead to some latency between the offset of
a sound and the onset of the following one. If you set a value smaller
than one the buffer size will be automatically set to the number of
samples in the sound that is being played.</p>
<p>Using an external command to play sounds generally works very well and
is fast on modern hardware. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> tries to detect available
play commands on your system each time it starts up. On Linux systems,
the recommended play command is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">aplay</span></tt>, which is installed by default
on most Linux distributions. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">aplay</span></tt> supports 24-bit output on 24-bit
soundcards with appropriate Linux drivers. Other possible play commands
are <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">play</span></tt>, which is provided by <a class="reference external" href="http://sox.sourceforge.net/">sox</a>
and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sndfile-play</span></tt>, which is provided by the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/">libsndfile</a> tools. You can call
another program by choosing “custom” in the “Play Command” drop-down
menu and spelling out the name of the command in the box below.</p>
<p>Currently, on Windows systems <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> cannot output sounds
directly to the soundcard. It writes instead a wav file and calls an
external play commands to output the sound. The recommended play command
is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">winsound</span></tt>. This command supports only 16-bit output.</p>
<p>Other possible play commands are <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">play</span></tt>, which is provided by
<a class="reference external" href="http://sox.sourceforge.net/">sox</a> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sndfile-play</span></tt>, which is
provided by the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/">libsndfile</a>
tools. These programs need to be installed by the user. If they are in
the system path, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> will detect them automatically. I am
not aware of any freely available play command that can output 24-bit
sound in Windows. Portaudio could be a used, and the Python bindings
provided by pyaudio have been recently ported to Python 3. I have not
tried this solution (and don’t have much time to do it), if you want to
try it, you need to be aware that in order to get 24-bit audio,
portaudio should be probably compiled with ASIO support, and compiling
portaudio on Windows with ASIO support is quite a complicated process.
Note that external media players with a graphical user interface (like
foobar2000) may not work well with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt>.</p>

<div class="section" id="parameters-files">
<h3>Parameters Files<a class="headerlink" href="#parameters-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>[sec:parameters:sub:<cite>f</cite>iles] Parameters files are plain text files,
that can be modified through <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> or through a text
editor. They contain a header with information that applies to all all
the experimental blocks stored in a parameters file, and sections
corresponding to the parameters that are specific to each experimental
block store in a parameters file. The header contains the following
fields:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Phones</li>
<li>Shuffle Mode</li>
<li>Sample Rate</li>
<li>Bits</li>
<li>Experiment Label</li>
<li>End Command</li>
</ul>
<p>You can refer to Section&nbsp;[sec:gui<sub>l</sub>eft<sub>p</sub>anel] to
know what each of these fields represents.</p>
<p>The sections that contain the parameters for each experimental block are
subdivided into fields that are separated by one or more dots. You
should not change this formatting when modifying parameters files.</p>
<p>A fragment from a parameters file is shown below:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>Paradigm: Adaptive
Intervals: 2 :False
Alternatives: 2 :False</pre>
</div>
<p>each entry here has two or three elements separated by colons. The first
element represents the variable of interest, the second element its
value, and the third element is a logical value that determines whether
the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">inSummary</span></tt> checkbox will be checked or not (see Section
[sec:tabular:sub:<cite>r</cite>esults<sub>f</sub>iles] for more info on this).
You can have one or more spaces between each element and the colon
separator. Each entry has to be written on a single line.</p>

<div class="section" id="results-files">
<h3>Results Files<a class="headerlink" href="#results-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>[sec:results:sub:<cite>f</cite>iles] <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> outputs several types of
results files. If you name your results file “myres”, the following
files will be output:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">myres.txt</span></tt>, “block summary”</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">myres_full.txt</span></tt> “full file”</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">myres_table.csv</span></tt> “table block summary”</li>
</ul>
<p>two further files can be derived from these:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">myres_res.txt</span></tt> “session summary”</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">myres_table_processed.txt</span></tt> “table session summary”</li>
</ul>
<p>The “block summary” results file has no special suffix, and contains
summaries for each experimental block that was run. The “full” results
file has a “_full” suffix and contains information for each single
trial. The “block summary” results file can be usually processed to
obtain a “session summary” results file with a “_res” suffix, that
contains summaries for an entire experimental session. In this file the
results are averaged across different blocks that have exactly the same
parameters.</p>
<p>All these files are human and machine-readable, but they are not very
machine-friendly for data analysis. That is, they can require quite a
lot of either manual work or programming code to separate the headers
and the labels from the values of interest (e.g., thresholds or <em>d’</em>
values) before the data can be input to a statistical software package.
For this reason, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> outputs also a “block summary table”
result file with a “_table” suffix that is written in a tabular format,
and contains summaries for each experimental block that was run. This
file can be further processed to obtain a “session summary table”
results file with a “_table_processed” suffix, that contains summaries
for an entire experimental session. In this file the results are
averaged across different blocks that have exactly the same parameters
stored in the “_table” file.</p>
<p>In order to obtain the “_res” and “_table_processed” session summary
files you need to use the appropriate functions that can be accessed
from the “File” menu. Alternatively, you can check the “Process results
when finished” checkbox in the “Preferences” window to let
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> automatically process these files at the end of an
experimental session. If processing the result files manually, choose
“Process Results” from the “File” menu, to convert a block summary file
into a “_res” session summary file. Choose “Process Results Table” to
convert a block summary table file into a “_table_processed” session
summary file. In both cases you will need to use the appropriate
subfunction for the paradigm (e.g., adaptive, constant 1-interval
2-alternatives, etc…) that was used in the experiment. You can choose to
process all blocks present in the file (default action), the last
<span class="math">\(n\)</span> blocks (of each condition), or a range of blocks (for each
condition). Once you have selected the file to process and specified the
blocks to process you can click “Run!” to perform the processing.</p>
<p>The tabular results files are comma separated value (csv) text files
that can be opened in a text file editor or a spreadsheet application.
The separator used by default is the semicolon “;”, but another
separator can be specified in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> preferences window.
When processing block summary table files, make sure that the csv
separator in the “Process Results Table” window matches the separator
used in the file.</p>
<p>[sec:tabular:sub:<cite>r</cite>esults<sub>f</sub>iles] The tabular result files
contain a number of default columns, that are specific to the paradigm
used in the experiment (e.g., threshold, number of trials etc…). Columns
with additional parameters can be stored in these files. Several text
fields and choosers in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> have what we will call
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">inSummary</span></tt> check boxes. Some of these are shown marked by ellipses in
Figure&nbsp;[fig:inSummaryCheckBoxes].</p>
<p>[!h] <img alt="image6" src="_images/inSummaryCheckBoxes.png" /> [fig:inSummaryCheckBoxes]</p>
<p>In the example shown in Figure&nbsp;[fig:inSummaryCheckBoxes] the frequency,
level and ear parameters will be stored, each in a separate column, in
the block summary table (“_table”) file, while the parameters
corresponding to the unchecked boxes (duration, ramps and type) will be
not. This is useful if you are running an experiment in which you are
systematically varying only a few parameters across different blocks,
and want to keep track of only those parameters. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">inSummary</span></tt> check
boxes also provide visual landmarks for quickly spotting the widgets
with your parameters of interest in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt>.</p>
<p>Notice that the “Process Results Table” function, as mentioned in the
previous section, will average the results for blocks with the same
parameters stored in the block summary table (“_table”) file. This
means that if you are varying a certain parameter (e.g., level) across
blocks, but you don’t check the corresponding <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">inSummary</span></tt> check box
(for each block), the value of the parameter will not be stored in the
block summary table (“_table”) file, and as a consequence the “Process
Results Table” function will not be able to sort the blocks according to
the “level” parameter, and will average the results across all blocks.
Not all is lost, because the “level” parameter will be nonetheless
stored in the “block summary” file, but you will need more work before
you can process your results with a statistical software package.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> automatically saves backup copies of the “block
summary” and “full” files in a backup folder. On Linux systems this
folder is located in</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>~/.local/share/data/pychoacoustics/data_backup</pre>
</div>
<p>on Windows systems it is located in</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>C:\\Users\username\.local\share\data\pychoacoustics\data_backup</pre>
</div>
<p>where <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">username</span></tt> is your account login name. A separate file is saved
for each block of trials that is run. These files are named according to
the date and time at which the blocks were started (the naming follows
the YY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS scheme). Unlike other results files, that are
written only once a block of trials has been completed, these log
results files get written as soon as information is available (e.g., a
new line in the “full” results file is written at the end of each
trial).</p>

<h3>Block Presentation Position<a class="headerlink" href="#block-presentation-position" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>[sec:shuffling]</p>
<p>We will define the serial position at which a block is presented during
an experimental session as its “presentation position”, and the serial
position at which a block is stored in a parameters file as its “storage
point”.</p>
<p>Clicking the “Shuffle” button randomises the presentation positions of
the blocks, but leaves the order in which the blocks are stored in a
parameters file untouched. The “Previous” and “Next” buttons, as well as
the “Jump to Block” chooser let you navigate across the blocks storage
points, while the “Previous Position”, and the “Next Position” buttons,
as well as the “Jump to Position” chooser let you navigate across the
blocks presentation positions.</p>
<p>The block presentation positions are recorded in the parameters files.
This is useful in case you have to interrupt an experimental session
whose block presentation positions had been randomized, before it is
finished, and continue it at a later date. In this case you can save the
parameters file, reload it next time, and let the listener complete the
experimental blocks that s/he had not run because of the interruption.
Notice that each time you load a parameters file <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> will
automatically move to the first block presentation position. Therefore,
you will have to note down what was the last block that your listener
had run in the interrupted session (or find out by looking at the
results file) and move to the presentation position of the following
block yourself.</p>
<p>By default clicking on the “Shuffle” button performs a simple full
randomization of the block presentation positions. However, you can
specify more complex shuffling schemes in the “Shuffling Scheme” text
field. Let’s say you want to present two tasks in your experiment, a
frequency discrimination and an intensity discrimination task. Each task
has four subconditions, (e.g.&nbsp;four different base frequencies for the
frequency discrimination task and four different base intensities for
the intensity discrimination task). Your parameters file will contain
eight blocks in total, blocks one to four are for the frequency
discrimination task and blocks five to eight are for the intensity
discrimination task. During the experiment you want your participants to
run first the four frequency discrimination conditions in random order,
and afterwards the four intensity discrimination conditions in random
order. To achieve this you can enter the following shuffling scheme:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">([</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">])</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>basically you specify sequences (which can be nested) with your
experimental blocks, sequences within round parentheses <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">()</span></tt> are not
shuffled, while sequences within square brackets <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">[]</span></tt> are shuffled.
Following the previous example, if you want to present first the four
blocks of one of the tasks (either frequency or intensity) in random
order, and then the four blocks of the other task in random order, you
would specify your shuffling scheme as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">[[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">]]</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>on the other hand, if you want to present first the four blocks of one
of the tasks (either frequency or intensity) in sequential order and
then the four blocks of the other task in sequential order, you would
specify your shuffling scheme as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">[(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">)]</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>you can have any variation you like on the theme, and the lists can be
nested ad libitum, so for example you could have:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">[(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,[</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">]),</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">)]</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>this would instruct <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> to present first either the four
frequency conditions or the four intensity conditions. The first two
frequency conditions are presented sequentially, while the last two are
shuffled. To save typing you can give ranges rather than listing all
blocks individually. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">([</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">])</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>is equivalent to:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">([</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">])</span>

<p>[sec:end:sub:<cite>c</cite>md]</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> can be instructed to run operating system (OS)
commands at the end of an experiment. This may be useful to run custom
scripts that may analyse the result files, backup result files or
perform other operations.</p>
<p>In the control window, you can enter commands that you want to be
executed at the end of a specific experiment in the &#8220;End Command&#8221; box.
This command will be saved in the parameters file of the experiment.</p>
<p>In the &#8220;Preferences Dialog&#8221;, under the &#8220;Notifications&#8221; tab you can
instead set a command that will be executed at the end of each
experiment you run, or <span class="math">\(n\)</span> blocks before the end of each
experiment you run. These commands should be entered in the &#8220;Execute
custom command&#8221; boxes.</p>
<p>The commands that you can execute are OS commands, therefore they are
different on Linux and Windows platforms. On Linux, for example,
assuming that you store all your experimental results in the directory
&#8220;/home/foo/exp/&#8221;, you could automatically make a backup of these files
in the directory &#8220;/home/foo/backup/exp/&#8221; by using the command</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>rsync -r -t -v --progress -s /home/foo/exp/ /home/foo/backup/exp/</pre>
</div>
<p>To make things more interesting, you can use some special strings to
pass <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> internal variables to your commands. For
example, if you want to copy the results file of the current experiment
to the directory &#8220;/home/foo/res/&#8221;, you can use the command</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>cp [resFile] /home/foo/backup/exp/</pre>
</div>
<p>here the special string <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">[resFile]</span></tt> will be converted to the name of
the file where <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> has saved the data. A full listing of
these special strings is given in Table&nbsp;[tab:end<sub>c</sub>md].</p>

<p>where <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">username</span></tt> is your Windows login username. Although I strive to
avoid this, the way in which the preferences settings are stored may
change in newer versions of pychoacoustics. This means that when

<h3>Response Mode<a class="headerlink" href="#response-mode" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>[sec:response:sub:<cite>m</cite>ode]</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> was designed to run interactive experiments in which
a listener hears some stimuli and gives a response through a button or
key press. This is the default mode, called “Real Listener” mode.
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> provides two additional response modes, “Automatic”
and “Simulated Listener”. These modes can be set through the control
window.</p>
<p>In “Automatic” response mode, rather than waiting for the listener to
give a response, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> gives itself a response and proceeds
to the next trial. The probability that this automatic response is
correct can also be set through the control window. The “Automatic”
response mode has two main functions. The first is testing and debugging
an experiment. Rather than running the experiment yourself, you can
launch <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> in “Automatic” response mode and check that
everything runs smoothly, the program doesn’t crash, and the result
files are saved correctly. The second function of the automatic response
mode is to allow passive presentation of the stimuli. Some neuroimaging
experiments (e.g.&nbsp;electroencephalographic or functional magnetic
resonance recordings) are performed with listeners passively listening
to the stimuli. These experiments usually also require that the program
presenting the stimuli sends triggers to the recording equipment to flag
the start of a trial. Potentially this can also be done in
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> (and we’ve done it in our lab for
electroencephalographic recordings), but at the moment this
functionality is not implemented in a general way in the program.</p>
<p>The “Simulated Listener” mode is simply a hook that allows you to
redirect the control flow of the program to some code that simulates a
listener and provides a response. Notice that <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> does
not provide any simulation code in itself, the simulation code has to be
written by you for a specific experiment. If no simulation code is
written in the experiment file, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> will do nothing in
simulated listenr mode. Further details on how to use the “Simulated
Listener” mode are provided in Section&nbsp;[sec:simulations].</p>
<p>Both the “Automatic” and the “Simulated Listener” make recursive
function calls. In Python the number of recursive function calls that
you can make is limited. If your experiment passes this limit
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> will crash. The limit can be raised, up to a certain
extent (which is dependent on your operating system, see the
documentation for the setrecursionlimit function in the Python <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sys</span></tt>
module) through the “Max Recursion Depth” setting that you can find in
the preferences window, or set through a command line option when
running <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> from the command line. Notice that the total
number of recursive calls that your program will make to complete an
experiments will be higher than the number of trials in the experiment,
so you should set the “Max Recursion Depth” to a value higher than the
number of trials you’re planning to perform (how much higher I don’t
know, you should find out by trial and error, a few hundred points
higher is usually sufficient). If you’re planning to run a very high
number of trials in “Automatic” or “Simulated Listener” mode, rather
than raising the max recursion depth, it may be better to split the
experiment in several parts. You can always write a script that
automatically launches <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> from the command line
instructing it to load a given parameters file. On UNIX machines you
could write a shell script to do that, but an easier way is perhaphs to
use python itself to write the script. For example, the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python</span></tt>
script could be:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c">#! /usr/bin/env python</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">):</span>
   <span class="n">cmd</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;pychoacoustics --file prms.prm -l L1 -s s1 -q -a </span><span class="se">\</span>
<span class="s">         --recursion-depth 3000&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>here we’re telling <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> to load the parameters file
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">prms.prm</span></tt>, set the listener identifier to “L1” and the session label
to s1. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-q</span></tt> option instructs the program to exit at the end of the
experiment. This way the recursion depth count is effectively restarted
each time <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> is closed and launched again from the
script. When the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--recursion-depth</span></tt> option is passed as a command
line argument, as in the example above, it overrides the max recursion
depth value set in the preferences window. If the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-a</span></tt> option is
passed, as in the examples above, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> will start
automatically at the beginning of each of the five series . This is
useful for debugging or simulations, so that you can start the script
and leave the program complete unattended (you need to make sure that
the “Shuffling Mode” is not set to “Ask” and that you pass listener and
session labels if you want the program to run completely unattended).</p>

<h2>Designing Custom Experiments<a class="headerlink" href="#designing-custom-experiments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<div><p>[sec:cutom:sub:<cite>e</cite>xp]</p>
<p>In order to add a new experiment to</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt>, create a directory in your home folder called
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics_experiments</span></tt>, inside this folder create a subfolder
called <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">custom_experiments</span></tt>. Each experiment is written in a single
file contained in this folder. Let’s imagine we want to create an
experiment for a simple frequency discrimination task. We create a file
named <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">freq.py</span></tt> in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">custom_experiments</span></tt> folder. In addition to
the experiment file we need an additional file that lists all the
experiments contained in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">custom_experiments</span></tt> directory. This file
must be named <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__init__.py</span></tt>, and in our case it will have the
following content:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>   __all__ = [&quot;freq&quot;]


here the variable ``__all__`` is simply a python list with the name of</pre>
</div>
<p>the experiment files. So, if one day we decide to write a new experiment
on, let’s say, level discrimination, in a file called <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">lev.py</span></tt> we
would simply add it to the list in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__init__.py</span></tt>:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>   __all__ = [&quot;freq&quot;,
              &quot;lev&quot;]


For people familiar with packaging Python modules it should be clear</pre>
</div>
<p>by now that the custom experiments folder is basically a Python package
containing various modules (the experiment files). If at some point we
want to remove an experiment from <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt>, for example
because it contains a bug that does not allow the program to start, we
can simply remove it from the list in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__init__.py</span></tt></p>
<blockquote>
<div>Let’s go back</div></blockquote>
<p>to the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">freq.py</span></tt> file. Here we need to define four functions. For our
example the names of these functions would be:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>   initialize_freq()
   select_default_parameters_freq()
   get_fields_to_hide_freq()
   doTrial_freq()


basically the function names consist of a fixed prefix, followed by</pre>
</div>
<p>the name of the experiment file. So in the case of the level experiment
example written in the file <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">lev.py</span></tt>, our four functions would be
called:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>   initialize_lev()
   select_default_parameters_lev()
   get_fields_to_hide_lev()
   doTrial_lev()


we’ll look at each function in details shortly. Briefly, the</pre>
</div>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">initialize_</span></tt> function is used to set some general parameters and
options for our experiment; the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">select_default_parameters_</span></tt> function
lists all the widgets (text fields and choosers) of our experiment and
their default values; the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">get_field_to_hide_</span></tt> function is used to
dinamically hide or show certain widgets depending on the status of
other widgets; finally, the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">doTrial_</span></tt> function contains the code that
generates the sounds and plays them during the experiment.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">initialize_</span></tt> function of our frequency discrimination</div></blockquote>
<p>experiment looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>   def initialize_freq(prm):
     exp_name = &quot;Frequency Discrimination Demo&quot;
     prm[&quot;experimentsChoices&quot;].append(exp_name)
     prm[exp_name] = {}
     prm[exp_name][&quot;paradigmChoices&quot;] = [&quot;Adaptive&quot;,
                                         &quot;Weighted Up/Down&quot;,
                                         &quot;Constant m-Intervals n-Alternatives&quot;]

     prm[exp_name][&quot;opts&quot;] = [&quot;hasISIBox&quot;, &quot;hasAlternativesChooser&quot;,
                              &quot;hasFeedback&quot;, &quot;hasIntervalLights&quot;]

     prm[exp_name][&quot;execString&quot;] = &quot;freq&quot;
     return prm

<p>in details in Section&nbsp;[sec:experiment<sub>o</sub>pts]. In brief, for our

<h2>Troubleshooting<a class="headerlink" href="#troubleshooting" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> saves the results at the end of each block, therefore
only the results from the last uncompleted block will be lost, the
results of completed blocks will not be lost. If you have an experiment
with many different blocks presented in random order it may be difficult
to see which blocks the listener had already completed and set
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> to run only the blocks that were not run. To address
this issue <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> keeps a copy of the parameters, including
the block presentation order after shuffling, in a file called
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.tmp_prm.prm</span></tt> (this is a hidden file on Linux systems). Therefore,
after the crash you can simply load this parameters file and move to the
block position that the listener was running when the computer crashed
to resume the experiment.</p>
<p>A second function of the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.tmp_prm.prm</span></tt> file is to keep a copy of
parameters that were stored in memory, but not saved to a file. If your
computer crashed while you were setting up a parameters for an
experiment that were not yet saved (or were only partially saved) to a
file, you can retrieve them after the crash by loading the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.tmp_prm.prm</span></tt> file. One important thing to keep in mind is that the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.tmp_prm.prm</span></tt> will be overwritten as soon as new parameters are
stored in memory by a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pychoacoustics</span></tt> instance opened in the same
directory. Therefore it is advisable to make a copy of the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.tmp_prm.prm</span></tt> file renaming it to avoid accidentally loosing its
contents after the crash.</p>

words.</p>
<p>A <strong>&#8220;Transparent&#8221;</strong> copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the general
public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly
with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic
paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor,
and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic
translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose
markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format
is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy
that is not &#8220;Transparent&#8221; is called <strong>&#8220;Opaque&#8221;</strong>.</p>
<p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII
without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML
using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated
HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output
purposes only.</p>
<p>The <strong>&#8220;Title Page&#8221;</strong> means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats
which do not have any title page as such, &#8220;Title Page&#8221; means the text
near the most prominent appearance of the work’s title, preceding the
beginning of the body of the text.</p>
<p>A section <strong>&#8220;Entitled XYZ&#8221;</strong> means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as <strong>&#8220;Acknowledgements&#8221;</strong>,
<strong>&#8220;Dedications&#8221;</strong>, <strong>&#8220;Endorsements&#8221;</strong>, or <strong>&#8220;History&#8221;</strong>.) To <strong>&#8220;Preserve
the Title&#8221;</strong> of such a section when you modify the Document means that
it remains a section &#8220;Entitled XYZ&#8221; according to this definition.</p>
<p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License,
but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that
these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the
meaning of this License.</p>
<p><strong>2. VERBATIM COPYING</strong></p>
<p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to
the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying
of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.</p>
<p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.</p>
<p><strong>3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</strong></p>
<p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:
Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back
cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the
publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title
with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add
other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited
to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other
respects.</p>
<p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.</p>
<p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
computer-network location from which the general network-using public
has access to download using public-standard network protocols a
complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If
you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when
you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
the public.</p>
<p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.</p>
<p><strong>4. MODIFICATIONS</strong></p>
<p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the
conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the
Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version
filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and
modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.
In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which
should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the
Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the
original publisher of that version gives permission.</li>
<li>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.</li>
<li>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified
Version, as the publisher.</li>
<li>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.</li>
<li>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent
to the other copyright notices.</li>
<li>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.</li>
<li>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s license notice.</li>
<li>Include an unaltered copy of this License.</li>
<li>Preserve the section Entitled &#8220;History&#8221;, Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If
there is no section Entitled &#8220;History&#8221; in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.</li>
<li>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the
network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was
based on. These may be placed in the &#8220;History&#8221; section. You may omit
a network location for a work that was published at least four years
before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the
version it refers to gives permission.</li>
<li>For any section Entitled &#8220;Acknowledgements&#8221; or &#8220;Dedications&#8221;,
Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
and/or dedications given therein.</li>
<li>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in
their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are
not considered part of the section titles.</li>
<li>Delete any section Entitled &#8220;Endorsements&#8221;. Such a section may not be
included in the Modified Version.</li>
<li>Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &#8220;Endorsements&#8221; or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.</li>
<li>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices
that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from
the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these
sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of
Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s license notice. These
titles must be distinct from any other section titles.</p>
<p>You may add a section Entitled &#8220;Endorsements&#8221;, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties–for
example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by
an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.</p>
<p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover
Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements
made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text
for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by
the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another;
but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the
previous publisher that added the old one.</p>
<p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.</p>
<p><strong>5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS</strong></p>
<p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license
notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.</p>
<p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding
at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or
publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the
same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections
in the license notice of the combined work.</p>
<p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &#8220;History&#8221; in
the various original documents, forming one section Entitled &#8220;History&#8221;;
likewise combine any sections Entitled &#8220;Acknowledgements&#8221;, and any
sections Entitled &#8220;Dedications&#8221;. You must delete all sections Entitled
&#8220;Endorsements&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</strong></p>
<p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.</p>
<p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.</p>
<p><strong>7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</strong></p>
<p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and
independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an &#8220;aggregate&#8221; if the copyright resulting
from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the
compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the
Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the
other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works
of the Document.</p>
<p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies
of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the
entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed on covers
that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic
equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise
they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.</p>
<p><strong>8. TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute
translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing
Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from
their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all
Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these
Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and
all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers,
provided that you also include the original English version of this
License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In
case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version
of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
prevail.</p>
<p>If a section in the Document is Entitled &#8220;Acknowledgements&#8221;,
&#8220;Dedications&#8221;, or &#8220;History&#8221;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its
Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.</p>
<p><strong>9. TERMINATION</strong></p>
<p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy,
modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
full compliance.</p>
<p><strong>10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</strong></p>
<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns. See <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.</p>
<p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If
the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License &#8220;or any later version&#8221; applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.</p>
<p><strong>ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</strong></p>
<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Copyright ©YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy, distribute
and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free
Documentation License, Version 1.2 or any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no
Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is
included in the section entitled &#8220;GNU Free Documentation License&#8221;.</div></blockquote>
<p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the &#8220;with...Texts.&#8221; line with this:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being
LIST.</div></blockquote>
<p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.</p>
<p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.</p>
