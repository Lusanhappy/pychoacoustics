 
To do:

High priority:

- write tests, for example the output of sound generating functions could be compared to stored numpy arrays, the output of procedures could be fixed with set seed and compared with result files
- Check bug with repetitions and automatic mode
- Add tools to fit psychometric functions (pystan or pymc)

Medium priority:

- add beta or other tags to the builds
- add plots for all paradigms
- Add 'Delete All' button?
- ABX process and process results text
- Figure out way to add instructions at the beginning of a task
- Correct/Incorrect and smiley feedback options. Also, add the ability to change color of feedback lights.
- Write 'what's this' and tooltips for all widgets.

Low priority:

- zip files before sending by e-mail
- edited fields and choosers change color (use on editing finished)
- block performance feedback at the end of each block? (usually not very good, participants should not know about different conditions)
- generate html report through intermediate rst file
- add d' calculation tools
- vocal responses at beginning end of each block (?)
- use the logging module to do the logging (?)
- the full file could optionally record the start of each sound and the time the listener responded 
- replace os.system with subprocess, possibly popen for sending kill signal #partly done
- Qthread for playing audio
- plot track from adaptive procedure
- on pyqt5 a QMainWindow without a parent is a primary window and has an entry in the taskbar, but a
QMainWindow with a parent is a secondary window and doesn't have an entry in the task bar (see http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/application-windows.html). The
response box, being a child of the control window doesn't have an entry in the task bar and cannot
be shown independently of the control window, which is annoying. A solution might be to set the response
box parent to `None` (not sure it works). There would be at least two consequences. First the response
box and associated widgets rely heavily on the parent attribute to exchange data/methods with the control
window, so this should be handled in another way. Second, the response box should close when the control
window closes.
- Internazionalization:
   - all the functions printing numbers '{0:5.3f}'.format(myFloat) should use self.currLocale.toString()
   - the sndlib and other modules should use translations too
